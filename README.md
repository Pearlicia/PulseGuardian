# Agent Name: "The Sentinel: Intelligent Supply Chain Guardian"

## The Real-World Problem:

Small businesses struggle to track competitor pricing and supply chain disruptions (news, weather, strikes) because they can't afford expensive analysts.

## What Sentinel Agent does:

**Monitors:** The Agent (Kestra) runs every morning.

**Scrapes:** It fetches product prices from 3 competitor websites and "supply chain news" from RSS feeds.

**Reasons (Gemini):** It uses Google Gemini to summarize the news ("Is there a disruption risk?") and compare prices.

**Acts:** If a risk is high, it auto-drafts an email to suppliers. Finally, it pushes a daily report to a public Vercel dashboard.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
